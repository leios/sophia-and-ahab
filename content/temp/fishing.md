I was born in a relatively poor fishing village at the start of Earth's Intergalactic Era.
While I was learning to follow the ocean currents, I would dream of eventually manning another ship -- one that sailed the stars instead of the sea.
My father was a grumpy-gilled sailor with a pork belly and peg leg, but he taught me everything I know.
We would often find ourselves bobbing around on our little dinghy for hours.
I would cast the net, he would pull it in.
That was life.
Simple, but still somewhat satisfying.
We made it work.

After a few years of unremarkable days, my father and I became rather close.
We would talk to each other about everything and became each other's confidants.
Admittedly, I was so young at the time that I didn't have much to confess, so I would often times just listen to my father talk for hours on end.
For many children, this might sound like a nightmare, but I enjoyed it.
I was the only kid my age in the village and my father was the only adult who was willing to talk to me like a real person.

After a particularly grueling and stormy day, we found ourselves out rather late.
At some point, the rain subsided and clouds vanished, unveiling a clear sky filled with stars.
My father took a deep breath and said, "I think that's that. We hit our quota."
But instead of heading back to shore, he turned off all the lights and set the boat adrift.

Confused, I said, "We might want to get home soon. I have school work to do."

"Schoolwork, eh?"
He sat down and sighed.
"School never taught me to sail. It never taught me to fish. Everything I learned, I learned by *doing*!"
I had heard this rant many times before and decided to sit down for the rest of it, but instead of continuing, he looked to me for a moment and , "Son, what do you want to do with your life?"

In that moment, I knew the answer. I wanted to be a space captain. I wanted to soar through space like the astronauts on TV, but I knew no matter how hard I tried, I would never get there. So I lied, "I don't know, really. I like fishing, I guess."

"But you don't *love* it. Neither do I. It's a living. It worked for my dad and his dad and his dad. It's all we've ever known."
As my eyes adjusted to the moonlight, I saw him staring off to the sea.
"Look, son. How old are you now? 16, right?"

"Yeah"

"16..." He chuckled to himself and paused before continuing. "I spoke to your teacher. She says you are already past her regular high school curriculum and there isn't much left to teach you. Why are you still going to school?"

I was quiet for a full minute before responding, "I don't know. I like learning about what other people can do besides fishing, you know?"

He laughed, "Sounds like you actually hate fishing, then!"

"Honestly, I don't mind this." I motioned to the stars and sea. "This is nice."

"Aye, but it's a poor man's work." He then looked to me, "Now I'll ask ya again. Is there anything you really want to do?"

At that moment, we saw a bright light across the water, launching upwards towards the sky until fizzling out into one of the stars.
I pointed to it and said, "That. That's what I want to do."

"Alright." My father nodded, and revved the engine. "Let's go."

We didn't say anything to each other for the rest of the evening, but the next morning, my father was gone and so was the boat.
There was a note on the kitchen table:

> I made you breakfast.
>
> I spoke to your teacher and got us a library pass.
> There's a computer there with your name on it.
> 
> Don't worry about the fish.
> They won't miss ya
>
> - Dad
