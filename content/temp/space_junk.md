# Space Junk

I was born in a relatively poor fishing village at the start of Earth's Intergalactic Era.
Space flight had just been properly commercialized and hordes of people were migrating to Mars to terraform it, but that wasn't for people like us.
We could barely afford electricity every month, let alone a computer.
For us, space travel was light years away.
Even so, while I was learning to follow the ocean currents, I would dream of eventually manning another ship -- one that sailed the stars instead of the sea.

My father was a grumpy-gilled sailor with a pork belly and peg leg, but he taught me everything I know.
We would often find ourselves bobbing around on our skiff for hours, just the two of us.
I would cast the net, he would pull it in.
That was life.
Simple, but still somewhat satisfying.
We made it work.

After a few years of unremarkable days, my father and I became rather close.
We would talk to each other about everything and became each other's confidants, so to speak.
Admittedly, I was so young at the time that I didn't have much to talk about, so I would often just listen to my father for hours on end.
For many children, this might sound like a nightmare, but I enjoyed it.
I was the only kid my age in the village and my father was the only adult who was willing to talk to me like a real person.

After a particularly grueling and stormy day, we found ourselves out rather late.
At some point, the rain subsided and clouds vanished, unveiling a clear sky filled with stars.
After pulling in the net and dumping some fish, my father took a deep breath and said, "I think that's that. We hit our quota."
But instead of heading back to shore, he turned off all the lights and set the boat adrift.

Confused, I said, "We might want to get home soon. I have school work to do."

"Schoolwork, eh?"
Even in the darkness, I saw his sillhouette sit and remove his cap.
"School never taught me to sail. It never taught me to fish. Everything I learned, I learned by *doing*!"
I had heard this rant many times before and also decided to sit down for the rest of it, but he stopped there and looked to me for a moment before asking, "Son, what do you want to do with your life?"

In that moment, I knew the answer. I wanted to soar through space like the astronauts I heard about in school, but I knew no matter how hard I tried, I would never get there. So I lied, "I don't know, really. I like fishing, I guess."

"But you don't *love* it. Neither do I. It's a living, but just barely. It worked for my dad and his dad and his dad. It's all we've ever known."
He sighed, sounding defeated.
"Look, son. How old are you now? 16, right?"

"Yeah"

"16..." He chuckled to himself and paused again. "I spoke to your teacher. She says you are already past her regular high school curriculum and there isn't much left to teach you. Why are you still going to school?"

I was quiet for a full minute, watching the sky as my eyes adjusted to the light. Eventually, I said, "I don't know. I like learning about what other people can do besides fishing, you know?"

He laughed, "Sounds like you actually hate fishing, then!"

"Honestly, I don't mind this." I motioned to the stars and sea. "This is nice."

"Aye, but it's a poor man's work." He then looked to me, "Now I'll ask ya again. Is there anything you really want to do?"

At that moment, we saw a bright light across the water, launching upwards towards the sky until fizzling out into one of the stars.
It was another launch.
Another ship had made it to space.
I pointed to it and said, "That. That's what I want to do."

"Alright." My father nodded, and revved the engine. "Let's go."

We didn't say anything to each other for the rest of the evening, but when I woke the next morning, my father was gone and so was the boat.
There was a note on the kitchen table:

> I made you breakfast.
>
> I spoke to your teacher and got us a library pass.
> There's a computer there with your name on it.
> 
> Don't worry about the fish.
> They won't miss ya!
>
> Study hard.
>
> &ndash; Dad

For the next two years, I spent every day in the library, learning everything I could about aerospace, knowing that my father was working overtime to support me.
At 18, I passed the qualification exams and got a scholarship to an astronautical program at a local university.
At 24, I was a pilot.

After getting my license, a number of recruiters spoke to me.
Some needed travel to Mars. Some to Venus.
But there was one listing in particular that caught my eye.
It was a bit more local.

See, ever since Sputnik, humans have had a nasty habit of treating space as a dumping ground, creating a huge cluster of space junk orbiting the Earth.
The truth is that pilots do not need to do anything for most of their journey.
AI can launch, fly, and land almost every spacecraft without any problem; however, due to the huge amount of space debris, there is a "no AI zone" right outside of Earth's atmosphere where pilots must be in complete control.
This region of space is by far the most challenging to traverse and is why most people fear becoming an austronaut to begin with.

Well, it turns out there was a listing to clean up around Earth's orbit.
It didn't pay as well as other positions and was in one of the most trecherous regions of space, but the company promised to provide a space craft to all employees after five years of work.
That was an opportunity I couldn't pass up and is how I found myself navigating gravitational currents while fishing junk from space.

It was perfect.
Just like old times.

Whenever I passed our old village, I would wave to my father from my ship, hoping that he knew that one of the many stars was his son.
